## Overview

The IntelliJ IDEA Notes Plugin enhances your development experience by providing a dedicated tool window for managing notes. These notes are text files with Markdown syntax highlighting, allowing you to create, view, and edit notes conveniently within the IntelliJ IDEA environment. It's a handy tool for jotting down ideas, making notes while debugging, or documenting your investigations.
